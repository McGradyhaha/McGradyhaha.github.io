> 1. Key Observation: Trajectory prediction is a Streaming Processing Task.

> 2. Existing methods use agent-centric reference frames to achieve viewpoint invariance

Each agent's historical states are normalized in the agent’s local reference frame, which <mark>is determined by the
agent's position and heading at the current time step</mark>

Each map element is copied A times, and each copy is normalized in one agent's local reference frame

Each time the observation window slides forward, the “current time step” also shifts accordingly, and all inputs
need to be re-normalized based on the up-to-date reference frames

<mark>Due to the variation in input, we're forced to re-compute all time steps’ encodings even though the observation
windows largely overlap</mark>

> 3. Optimization

1. <mark>Set up a local spacetime coordinate system for
each agent state and each map element that a
query vector will derive from

2. Encode query elements’ inputs in local reference
frames
    * Inputs are independent of the global reference frame ->
avoid input re-normalization -> encodings are always
invariant -> enable reusing the encodings computed in
previous observation windows

3. Compute relative spatial-temporal positional
embeddings
    + Relative distance, relative direction, relative orientation,
time difference

4. Inject the relative positional embeddings into the
key and value elements in the attention layers
    * To help the attention layers be aware of the difference
between local reference frames
